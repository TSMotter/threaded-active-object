- Each folder containing a `CMakeLists.txt` file is seen as a stand alone small project that can be compiled and run by itself

- To build:
```bash
./bbuild.sh <target>
```

- To build and run:
```bash
./bbuild.sh <target> run
```

- Where "`<target>`" is one of the `Demo` folders
  - Example: `./bbuild.sh DemoActiveObject run`
